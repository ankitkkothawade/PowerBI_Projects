# Cohort Analysis Project 

## Overview

This project is dedicated to exploring customer behavior dynamics through the lens of cohort analysis. The primary focus is on unraveling valuable insights related to customer retention and Lifetime Value (LTV). Cohort analysis serves as a strategic tool to gain a deeper understanding of user actions, facilitating data-driven decisions for optimizing both customer satisfaction and revenue growth.

## Methodological Approach

### 1. Cohort Formation
   - In this initial step, cohorts are meticulously formed based on the customer acquisition date. Users are systematically grouped into cohorts, specifically organized according to the month or time frame of their initial engagement with the product or service.

### 2. Customer Retention Analysis
   - For each cohort, a comprehensive exploration of the retention rate is conducted. This analysis aims to provide insights into the effectiveness of customer retention strategies over varying periods.

### 3. Lifetime Value Calculation
   - The Lifetime Value (LTV) is calculated by meticulously estimating the total revenue generated by a cohort over its entire lifespan. This involves a thorough examination of purchasing patterns exhibited by customers within the cohort.
